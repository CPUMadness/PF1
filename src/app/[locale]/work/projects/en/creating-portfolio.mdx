## Overview

My first foray into JavaScript/TypeScript, this is my web-based portfolio.

## Technologies Used

- **NextJS**: Framework used for web development.
- **Once UI**: For building the front-end of the website.
- **Magic Portfolio**: Once UI template for web portfolios.
- **Vercel**: For hosting the website.
- **Git**: Used for Version Control.

## Challenges and Learnings

Switching from Python-based Django to NextJS was a learning curve at first, but proved to pay off with greater visuals and UX. Using JavaScript and TypeScript for the first time, things were a lot more "plug and play" compared to Python. I was able to develop this site using open source libraries such as Once UI, and was even able to consult the maintainers for development help. It was truly a great experience learning about JS & TS with likeminded people online.

## Outcome

The portfolio is now live on "danielsnodgrass.com". More features are to be added to this site as I continue learning more about JS/TS.
