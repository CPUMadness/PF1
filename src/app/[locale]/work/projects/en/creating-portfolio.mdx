## Overview

My first foray into JavaScript/TypeScript, this is my web-based portfolio.

## Technologies Used

- **NextJS**: Framework used for web development.
- **Once UI**: For building the front-end of the website.
- **Magic Portfolio**: Once UI-made template for web portfolios.
- **Vercel**: For hosting the website.
- **Git**: Used for Version Control.

## Challenges and Learnings

Switching from Python-based Django to NextJS was a learning curve at first, but proved to pay off with greater visuals and UX. Using JavaScript and TypeScript for the first time, things were a lot more "plug and play" compared to Python. I was able to develop this site using open source libraries such as "Once UI", and was even able to consult the maintainers for development help. It was truly a great experience learning about JS & TS with likeminded people online.

## Outcome

The automated Figma to code pipeline has streamlined the handoff process, cutting down design-to-development time by 40%. Designers now have more confidence that their designs will be accurately translated into code, and developers can focus on more complex logic and feature development. This project has proven the value of automation in bridging the gap between design and development.
