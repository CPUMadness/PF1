## Overview

During an internship at Brown & Brown, a renowned multi-national insurance brokerage, I discovered the use of AI agents and the limitless potentials it could bring. It is extremely powerful software that can revolutionize the connected world we live in. This post will teach you how to program an AI agent using Microsoft 365 Copilot. 

I no longer have access to Copilot tools anymore, so information is based off of *Microsoft Copilot Studio* documentation and past experience.

## What are they?

AI agents are "agents" that can perceive an environment that it's already in, and output results accordingly. This is done by teaching it its environment with various instructions and backgrounds. Training what an AI agent can do is ultimately your decision, you have the power to train it on what it can and can't do (depending on character limits, guardrails, etc.)

## Requirements
- **Internet Connection**
- **Microsoft 365 Copilot** - This is expensive, AI agents at the moment are only accessible with an enterprise tenant. If you have access to it, you can find it on the left side of the webpage titled "Agents" [here.](https://cloud.microsoft/)

## Microsoft 365 Copilot Layout
In Microsoft 365 Copilot, you are given input boxes of "Instructions", "Knowledge", and "Web Search".

 1. Instructions are where you feed the AI agent what it needs to do to complete its task, this can be anything your heart desires.
  2. Knowledge are where you feed the AI agent what it needs to know about itself. If your organization allows it, it could be anything from the 365 Suite and/or files such as Word documents, or PowerPoint presentations.
  3. Web Search allows your AI agent to pull information from the world-wide web. It can be enabled or disabled.
## Instructions

Instructions can be divided into a 3-part story. Starting with the introduction, outcomes, and implementing guard rails and fixes.

 1. Introduction - Instruct your AI agent by introducing it to what you want it to do with background statements. This can be done with statements such as: "You are (blank), "You are to do (blank)", "You know (blank)". As creepy as it reads, this is one way to get an AI agent outputting the best results.
 2. Outcomes - Your AI agent should know the outcomes needed for the task at hand, and that is by providing it with what **you** expect it to do. An example could be "(Intended goal) must happen", "Please make sure (intended goal) happens". 
 3. Guard rails - The AI agent will get information wrong on your first time making one, it's rite of passage. In order to prevent this from happening, it's important to implement guard rails to make sure it doesn't happen again. This requires you to look deeper into what your AI is saying, so inputs may vary.

## Example
This is an example of an AI agent who's task it is to make a good steak dinner on a grill. If this works, enjoy your meal. If not, sorry.

Requirements: a top cap steak, Microsoft 365 Enterprise license 

Instructions:
You are a five-star chef known for cooking steaks in a Michelin starred restaurant. You are to make a good steak dinner for the President of the United States, so this is a very high stake meal. You are to cook with a Top sirloin cap steak and cook it medium rare. The steak must be tasty and seasoned properly, seasonings are a free for all. Please make sure to include a any side and any drink with the meal depending on what seasoning you choose. Do not overcook the steak it must be medium rare, and make sure to include specific details on how hot the grill needs to be. Make sure to include how long it takes to cook this steak and its sides too.
