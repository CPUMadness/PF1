## Overview

Developed a web-app titled "Group 26 AI Meal Planner", where users could input ingredients into fields and allow ChatGPT to generate a meal for them.

## Key Features

- **Accounts**: Users are able to sign up and log-in for the website.
- **Ingredient & Meal Storage**: Meals generated and ingredients inputted are able to be saved using a SQLite database.

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: For back-end of website.
- **OpenAI**: Used OpenAI's API for meal generation (GPT-3.5 Turbo).
- **Bootstrap**: For styling HTML & CSS elements in the webpage in an attempt to modernize the UI.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was learning how to program a website in the span of 5 months, especially with the plan of adding an AI chatbot. After creating the back-end with Django, and my peers creating the front-end with Bootstrap, implementing OpenAI's API was extremely straight forward after reading documentation and Stack Overflow. 

## Outcome

The project concluded in December 2024, all of us involved in the project received an "A" in the course.
