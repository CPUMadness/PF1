## Backstory

In my senior year of high school, I was selected to be the "Cyber Officer" of my high school's AFJROTC unit. My goal was to migrate data from our 5GB Google Drive storage to the school district's OneDrive & Office 365 platform.  

## Process

The project was planned to be completed in 4 weeks. The project started by exporting all of the files from Google Drive onto an external drive, and then consulting with my JROTC leaders on what to delete and keep. After, all of the remaining files were added to OneDrive and required file sharing permissions were established.

## Challenges and Learnings

Due to limited user permissions, I was unable to transfer data directly to my student Office account from Drive. This was solved by working with my school's IT manager to coordinate a cloud data migration. Another challenge was determining which data from Drive needed to be transferred over, and which ones were to be deleted.

## Outcome

The project concluded in January 2020 with all data being successfully transferred. To make migrating to the Microsoft platform easier, a plan was made to procure school-owned desktops (pre-installed with M365 programs) to replace Air Force computers. This would save the unit in yearly equipment leasing fees, but due to the pandemic starting this never was finished.
